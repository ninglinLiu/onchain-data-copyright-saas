## 2 TaiShang on-chain AI Agent Defination

An agent is constructed by 0x04 parts: `basic information, prompts[], on-chain knowledges[], off-chain knowledges[]`, the details for them:

* `Basic information`: the basic information of the AI agent.
  * Type: `bodhi asset`
  * Example: [15536](https://bodhi.wtf/space/5/15536)
* `Prompts[]`: the list of prompts of the AI agent.
  * Type: `list of bodhi assets`
  * Example: [[15539](https://bodhi.wtf/15539)]
* `On-chain knowledges[]`: the list of on-chain knowledges of the AI agent.
  * Type: `list of bodhi assets`
  * Example:  [[15540](https://bodhi.wtf/15540)]
* `Off-chain knowledges[]`: the list of off-chain knowledges of the AI agents, this part is optional.
  * Type: `list of links`
  * Example: [[https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)]

> 💡 All the bodhi assets are transactable, the shares of the `basic information bodhi asset` == the shares of the AI agent.
